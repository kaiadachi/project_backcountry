And the Patagonia Women's Organic Cotton Quilt Snap-T Pullover Sweatshirt is one of the best things they make. There's a reason its light-wearing comfort and easy warmth stick around season after season. Made from a soft organic cotton blend, this pullover sports a classic diamond quilted pattern that also works as an effective heat-trapping system, letting you wear it alone to keep cozy on the couch or throw it on as a layer for your next winter adventure. Keep the cold out on fall hikes or summer nights around the campfire with a buttoned stand up collar and cuffs at the hip and sleeves. A buttoned chest pocket adds detailing and convenient storage for smaller items.

It also packs up small for travel and works as a top layer for Chicago shopping forays. Down insulation packs a powerful punch of heat without weighing heavily on your shoulders or taking up too much space in your suitcase.
Recycled polyester ripstop inside and out fends off frisky twigs and grabby thorns to keep this jacket looking good for years on end. The 800-fill Traceable Down uses feathers from geese that were treated right their whole lives, from not being force-fed to staying fully feathered until after they've passed. Horizontal quilting keeps the insulation in line for consistent, all-over warmth, while the feminine silhouette provides flattering style. Between the svelte touch and the consciously responsible materials, you'll try to find a reason to wear this light jacket year-round.
