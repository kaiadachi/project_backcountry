,Arc'teryx,,,,,,,new,新品,レディーズ,"その日の驚くべき事実ではありません。山の嵐はどこにもないところから出てきて、本当に速く動きます。穏やかなブルーバードの日だったことは突然深刻な高山の経験に変わることができます、そしてあなたが嵐のように速く動くことができない限りあなたは乾いた状態を保つことができないでしょう。たったの10.8オンスの重量で、Arc'teryx Alpha SLメンズジャケットはあなたを嵐の一歩先をキープするでしょう、頑丈でコンパクトなレインシェルです。 Arc'teryxのAlphaコレクション（SLはsuperlightを意味します）の一部として、このシェルはあなたのハーネスやバックパックに留めるように設計されているので、あなたは常に長い登山と高山の遠征に備えています。軽量のナイロン製で、GoreTex PacLiteメンブレンで防水加工されたSLは、嵐の間にも送信できるように、e3Dの人間工学に基づいたアーティキュレート構造のトリムフィットを採用しています。
持ち運びを簡単にするために、SLはそれ自身のポケットに詰め込み、ウェビングループを介してあなたのハーネスに留めます。それが本当に厄介になるならば、StormHoodはあなたのヘルメットを覆い、片手のシンチで調節します、そしてWaterTightジッパーはあなたのジャケットにその方法を見つけることから卑劣な湿気を防ぎます。何よりもまず、取り外し可能なHemLockフォームインサートがSLの裾の周りにあり、ハーネスの下に滑り落ちて露出した皮膚が残るのを防ぎます。それが思慮深いデザインでなければ、何もありません。

What was a mellow bluebird day can suddenly turn into a serious alpine experience, and you won't be able to stay dry unless you can move as fast as the storm. Weighing in at just 10.8oz, the Arc'teryx Alpha SL Men's Jacket is a tough and compact rain shell that'll keep you one step ahead of the storm. As part of Arc'teryx's Alpha collection (the SL stands for superlight), this shell is designed to be clipped onto your harness or backpack, so you're always prepared on long climbs and alpine expeditions. Made of lightweight nylon and waterproofed with a GoreTex PacLite membrane, the SL sports a trim fit with e3D ergonomic and articulated construction to keep you sending during the storm, and provides clean sightlines to your harness so you can grab the right protection without hassle.
To keep carrying simple, the SL packs into its own pocket and clips to your harness via a webbing loop, keeping it out of the way but close at hand should the weather turn. If it gets really nasty, the StormHood covers your helmet and adjusts with a onehanded cinch, and a WaterTight zipper stops sneaky moisture from finding its way into your jacket. Maybe best of all, the removable HemLock foam insert sits around the hem of the SL, keeping it from slipping up underneath your harness and leaving exposed skin. If that's not thoughtful design, nothing is.

"[membrane/laminate] Gore-Tex Paclite (2-layer), [face fabric] N40r (nylon)",Arc'teryx,,,,,,Toreador,new,新品,レディーズ,,JP Parallel Import,"Unsurprising fact of the day: mountain storms come out of nowhere and move really quickly. What was a mellow bluebird day can suddenly turn into a serious alpine experience, and you won't be able to stay dry unless you can move as fast as the storm. Weighing in at just 10.8oz, the Arc'teryx Alpha SL Men's Jacket is a tough and compact rain shell that'll keep you one step ahead of the storm. As part of Arc'teryx's Alpha collection (the SL stands for superlight), this shell is designed to be clipped onto your harness or backpack, so you're always prepared on long climbs and alpine expeditions. Made of lightweight nylon and waterproofed with a GoreTex PacLite membrane, the SL sports a trim fit with e3D ergonomic and articulated construction to keep you sending during the storm, and provides clean sightlines to your harness so you can grab the right protection without hassle.
To keep carrying simple, the SL packs into its own pocket and clips to your harness via a webbing loop, keeping it out of the way but close at hand should the weather turn. If it gets really nasty, the StormHood covers your helmet and adjusts with a onehanded cinch, and a WaterTight zipper stops sneaky moisture from finding its way into your jacket. Maybe best of all, the removable HemLock foam insert sits around the hem of the SL, keeping it from slipping up underneath your harness and leaving exposed skin. If that's not thoughtful design, nothing is.
