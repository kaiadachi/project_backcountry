,Patagonia,,new,レディーズ,"もしそうなら、パタゴニアレディースダウンセータージャケットをすべての取引のジェーンとして考えてみてください。このジャケットは、シーズン初期のアイスクライミング、真冬のスキー、または寒い冬の気温でさりげなく着用するのに理想的な万能構造です。その名前が示すように、Down Sweaterは軽量で圧縮可能な800-fill Traceable Downを装備しています。これは、このジャケットを羽毛で覆っているガチョウが強制給餌されたり、活力を取り戻されたりすることがないことを意味します。さらに、断熱材は独立した第三者機関であるNSFの認証を受けています。
ダウン断熱材は上品でダンディーですが、それをほとんど保護することなしには事実上役に立ちません。そのため、パタゴニアのデザイナーは、ジャケットの軽量な構成を損なうことなくコアの暖かさを保護する耐久性のあるリサイクルリップストップ外観を備えました。そしてあなたの防御を強化するために、DWR治療は軽い湿気を容易に流します、それであなたは母なる大自然があなたの方法を投げようと関係なく暖かくて快適にいます。水平バッフルが縫い付けられてダウンをシャッフルさせないように縫い付けられています。つまり、最新の輪郭にフィットしたフィットとやや長い裾の長さがあなたの保護を倍増させます。さらに、ジッパー式のハンドポケットが小さな必需品を近くにしっかりと保ち、内部の胸ポケットはジャケットのためのもの袋に簡単に変わります。

This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for early-season ice climbing, mid-winter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800-fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never force-fed or live-plucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protectionwhich is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.
