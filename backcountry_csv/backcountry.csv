This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for early-season ice climbing, mid-winter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800-fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never force-fed or live-plucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protection—which is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.

This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for early-season ice climbing, mid-winter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800-fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never force-fed or live-plucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protection—which is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.

This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for early-season ice climbing, mid-winter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800-fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never force-fed or live-plucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protection—which is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.
