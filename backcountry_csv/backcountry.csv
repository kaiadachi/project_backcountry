,Patagonia,,new,レディーズ,"もしそうなら、パタゴニアレディースダウンセータージャケットをすべての取引のジェーンとして考えてみてください。このジャケットは、早い時期のアイスクライミング、真冬のスキー、寒い冬の気温の下でのカジュアルな着用に理想的な万能構造です。その名前が示すように、Down Sweaterは軽量で圧縮可能な800fillのTraceable Downを装備しています。さらに、断熱材は独立した第三者機関であるNSFの認証を受けています。
ダウン断熱材は上品でダンディーですが、それをほとんど保護することなしには事実上役に立ちません。そのため、パタゴニアのデザイナーは、ジャケットの軽量な構成を損なうことなくコアの暖かさを保護する耐久性のあるリサイクルリップストップ外観を備えました。そしてあなたの防御を強化するために、DWR治療は軽い湿気を容易に流します、それであなたは母なる大自然があなたの方法を投げようと関係なく暖かくて快適にいます。水平バッフルが縫い付けられてダウンをシャッフルさせないように縫い付けられています。つまり、最新の輪郭にフィットしたフィットとやや長い裾の長さがあなたの保護を倍増させます。さらに、ジッパー式のハンドポケットが小さな必需品を近くにしっかりと保ち、内部の胸ポケットはジャケットのためのもの袋に簡単に変わります。

  フィット感とやや長めの裾が暖かさを倍増",JP Parallel Import,"Consider the Patagonia Women's Down Sweater Jacket as a Jane of All Trades, if you will. This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for earlyseason ice climbing, midwinter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never forcefed or liveplucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protectionwhich is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.

The Nano Puff boasts a tenacious exterior thanks to the recycled polyester shell and lining, which when combined keeps wind out and warmth in, while the DWR treatment prevents light precipitation from getting the best of your time spent outside. PrimaLoft Gold Eco maintains a moderate warmthtoweight ratio, and ensures that you stay warm, even when wet.

内側と外側のリサイクルポリエステルリップストップは、このジャケットが何年にもわたって美しく見えるようにするために、しわになりやすい小枝とグラビーとげを取り除きます。 800fill Traceable Downは、ガチョウの羽毛を使用しています。これは、強制的に動かされていないものから、通り過ぎるまで羽毛が付いたままでいるものまであります。水平方向のキルティングは一貫した、全面的な暖かさのために断熱材を一直線に保ちます、一方、女性的なシルエットはお世辞のスタイルを提供します。ほのかな感触と意識的に責任ある材料の間で、あなたはこの軽いジャケットを一年中着る理由を見つけることを試みるでしょう。

Down insulation packs a powerful punch of heat without weighing heavily on your shoulders or taking up too much space in your suitcase.
Recycled polyester ripstop inside and out fends off frisky twigs and grabby thorns to keep this jacket looking good for years on end. The 800fill Traceable Down uses feathers from geese that were treated right their whole lives, from not being forcefed to staying fully feathered until after they've passed. Horizontal quilting keeps the insulation in line for consistent, allover warmth, while the feminine silhouette provides flattering style. Between the svelte touch and the consciously responsible materials, you'll try to find a reason to wear this light jacket yearround.

"[membrane/laminate] Gore-Tex Pro (3-layer), [face fabric] 70D nylon plain weave",Arc'teryx,Aurora,new,レディーズ,,JP Parallel Import,"All winter long, you're on high alert for the next big storm, the next refresher, or the next snowstealing powder hound who crosses through the fall line. In the Arc'teryx Women's Sentinel Jacket, your tours of duty through storms are warm and dry events. Guaranteed waterproof and breathable threelayer GoreTex Pro technology ensures your skihungry bod stays dry when the skies are spewing snow and you're hiking to the lookout. A relaxed cut lets you put your puffy underneath when temps nosedive. 
Being the first in line when ski patrol opens the world's best bowl matters to you. Traveling the traverse and sidestepping with speed gets your sweat going. Open the underarm vents to dump excess heat without losing your primo position in line. As you wait for the sign to change from Closed to Open, snap the powder skirt together to keep the snow spray from sneaking up your back. The hood holds your helmet so you don't have to choose between casing your cranium and a dry dome. When it's dumping and your enjoying fresh tracks every time, the laminated brim diverts a bit of the weather away from your face.

内部の湿気はバックカントリースキーヤーにとって最悪の敵である可能性があるため、防水性と通気性の究極の組み合わせを望んでいたので、Patsey Marleyの建設にはPolartecのNeoShell素材を選びました。それは典型的な膜よりも水蒸気を機能的に吸い上げながら風と雪をブロックし、皮膚のトラックで数分後にねっとりとしたベース層と一日中乾燥した暖かさの間の違いを生む。よだれ掛け自体は極度の伸縮性がある柔らかい貝の材料を特色にし、高関節区域のその通気性をさらに促進し、動きのフルレンジを促進します、一方、完全に関節のある膝は技術的なキックターンの制限を減らします。
物事が本当に熱くなり始めたら - そしてそれらがPatsey Marleyの急な尾根になるでしょう - 巨大な外側の大腿部の通気孔が空気の流れを可能にします、そしてまた自然が呼んだときに座席を作るために横に引っ張られることもできます。よだれかけの前面にある2つのポケットは日焼け止めやスキンワックスのような小さな必需品にぴったりです、そして念のために日がめったに起こされないcouloirへのラッペルを含むならば、2つの太ももポケットは戦略的にハーネスでアクセスできるように置かれます。
