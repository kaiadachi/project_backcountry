This jacket touts a versatile construction that makes it ideal for early-season ice climbing, mid-winter skiing, or casually wearing in cool winter temperatures. As its name suggests, the Down Sweater is equipped with lightweight and compressible 800-fill Traceable Down, meaning the geese whose feathers insulate this jacket are never force-fed or live-plucked. Additionally, the down insulation is certified by NSF, an independent third party.
Down insulation is fine and dandy, but it's virtually useless without a little extra protectionwhich is why the designers at Patagonia outfitted the jacket with a durable recycled ripstop exterior that safeguards your core warmth, without compromising the jacket's lightweight constitution. And to bolster your defense, a DWR treatment easily sheds light moisture, so you stay warm and comfortable no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. Horizontal baffles are sewn through to prevent the down from shuffling around, meaning you stay warmer, longer, while the updated, contoured fit and slightly longer hem length double down on your protection. Additionally, zippered hand pockets keep small necessities close by and secure, and an internal chest pocket easily converts into a stuff sack for the jacket.

"[exterior, lining] 100% recycled polyester, DWR treatment",Patagonia,Ikat Purple,new,レディーズ,"Whether you're posted up by the campfire, enjoying your seventh s'more of the evening or cruising up one of Castle Rock's famed routes, the Patagonia Women's Nano Puff Insulated Jacket provides lightweight warmth. The Nano Puff boasts a tenacious exterior thanks to the recycled polyester shell and lining, which when combined keeps wind out and warmth in, while the DWR treatment prevents light precipitation from getting the best of your time spent outside. PrimaLoft Gold Eco maintains a moderate warmth-to-weight ratio, and ensures that you stay warm, even when wet.
Additionally, the Nano is fashioned with a slightly more narrow fit than in years past, and the horizontal baffling isn't just a pretty faceit assures that the synthetic insulation stays in place for maximum warmth. The hem is fully adjustable with its low-profile drawcord, and the two zippered hand pockets keep necessities (like snacks and supplies) close by. A storm flap and zipper garage discourage chafing on your chin, and the internal chest pocket doubles as a stuff sack for the jacket, so you can stuff it, chuck it in your bag, and forget about it when temperatures start to warm up.

Head to the resort in The North Face Freedom Insulated Pant for a day that can't be ruined when the temperatures drop. The waterproof shell will keep you dry and the Heatseeker insulation offers some non-bulky warmth to keep you comfortable on cold chairlift rides.

The articulated knees offer freedom of movement as you navigate those difficult lines and the cargo and hand pockets store your snacks so you can refuel on the lifts. When you find yourself in powder pockets, the StretchVent gaiters with gripper elastic keep the flakes from creeping into your pant legs so you can stay warm and dry the whole day on the slopes.

It also packs up small for travel and works as a top layer for Chicago shopping forays. Down insulation packs a powerful punch of heat without weighing heavily on your shoulders or taking up too much space in your suitcase.
Recycled polyester ripstop inside and out fends off frisky twigs and grabby thorns to keep this jacket looking good for years on end. The 800-fill Traceable Down uses feathers from geese that were treated right their whole lives, from not being force-fed to staying fully feathered until after they've passed. Horizontal quilting keeps the insulation in line for consistent, all-over warmth, while the feminine silhouette provides flattering style. Between the svelte touch and the consciously responsible materials, you'll try to find a reason to wear this light jacket year-round.
