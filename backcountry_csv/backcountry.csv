The Nano Puff boasts a tenacious exterior thanks to the recycled polyester shell and lining, which when combined keeps wind out and warmth in, while the DWR treatment prevents light precipitation from getting the best of your time spent outside. PrimaLoft Gold Eco maintains a moderate warmthtoweight ratio, and ensures that you stay warm, even when wet.
Additionally, the Nano is fashioned with a slightly more narrow fit than in years past, and the horizontal baffling isn't just a pretty faceit assures that the synthetic insulation stays in place for maximum warmth. The hem is fully adjustable with its lowprofile drawcord, and the two zippered hand pockets keep necessities (like snacks and supplies) close by. A storm flap and zipper garage discourage chafing on your chin, and the internal chest pocket doubles as a stuff sack for the jacket, so you can stuff it, chuck it in your bag, and forget about it when temperatures start to warm up.

Additionally, the Nano is fashioned with a slightly more narrow fit than in years past, and the horizontal baffling isn't just a pretty faceit assures that the synthetic insulation stays in place for maximum warmth. The hem is fully adjustable with its lowprofile drawcord, and the two zippered hand pockets keep necessities (like snacks and supplies) close by. A storm flap and zipper garage discourage chafing on your chin, and the internal chest pocket doubles as a stuff sack for the jacket, so you can stuff it, chuck it in your bag, and forget about it when temperatures start to warm up.

The Canada Goose Women's Mystique Down Parka wraps your entire body in lofty down insulation to keep you as warm as you take in the wintry landscape. Canada Goose styled it with a real furr ruff to evoke a wintry style. If you ever get too warm, the Mystique can actually transform into a backpack so you can wear it without really wearing it.

In the Arc'teryx Women's Sentinel Jacket, your tours of duty through storms are warm and dry events. Guaranteed waterproof and breathable threelayer GoreTex Pro technology ensures your skihungry bod stays dry when the skies are spewing snow and you're hiking to the lookout. A relaxed cut lets you put your puffy underneath when temps nosedive. 
Being the first in line when ski patrol opens the world's best bowl matters to you. Traveling the traverse and sidestepping with speed gets your sweat going. Open the underarm vents to dump excess heat without losing your primo position in line. As you wait for the sign to change from Closed to Open, snap the powder skirt together to keep the snow spray from sneaking up your back. The hood holds your helmet so you don't have to choose between casing your cranium and a dry dome. When it's dumping and your enjoying fresh tracks every time, the laminated brim diverts a bit of the weather away from your face.

,Backcountry,,new,レディーズ,"私たちはバックカントリーギアヘッドなので、私たちの最愛のワサッチ山脈でのプリワーク夜明けパトロールは実質的に私たちの仕事の説明の中にあり、それらの職業資格は私たちがバックカントリーでの最大の日々。我々はFlylowに我々の洞察を提供しました、そしてそれは我々の厳しいスペックにBackcountry x FlylowパセイMarleyビブパンツを造るためにそのその確かな製品専門知識を使った。私たちのお気に入りの地元のバックカントリースキーランのひとつにちなんで名付けられた、これらのビブパンツはPatsey Marleyの早朝のラップがもたらすものすべてに備えています：ウエストディープパウダー、艶やかな風、雪が降る、そして急なスキントラック。
内部の湿気はバックカントリースキーヤーにとって最悪の敵である可能性があるため、防水性と通気性の究極の組み合わせを望んでいたので、Patsey Marleyの建設にはPolartecのNeoShell素材を選びました。それは典型的な膜よりも水蒸気を機能的に吸い上げながら風と雪をブロックし、皮膚のトラックで数分後にねっとりとしたベース層と一日中乾燥した暖かさの間の違いを生む。よだれ掛け自体は極度の伸縮性がある柔らかい貝の材料を特色にし、高関節区域のその通気性をさらに促進し、動きのフルレンジを促進します、一方、完全に関節のある膝は技術的なキックターンの制限を減らします。
物事が本当に熱くなり始めたら - そしてそれらがPatsey Marleyの急な尾根になるでしょう - 巨大な外側の大腿部の通気孔が空気の流れを可能にします、そしてまた自然が呼んだときに座席を作るために横に引っ張られることもできます。よだれかけの前面にある2つのポケットは日焼け止めやスキンワックスのような小さな必需品にぴったりです、そして念のために日がめったに起こされないcouloirへのラッペルを含むならば、2つの太ももポケットは戦略的にハーネスでアクセスできるように置かれます。
